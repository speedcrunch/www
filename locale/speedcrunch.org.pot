msgstr ""

#: features.html
msgid "Often, SpeedCrunch can still understand an incomplete expression."
msgstr ""

#: features.html
msgid "For example, just typing <tt>sin</tt> followed by Enter - likely means taking the sine of last value - is automatically translated as <tt>sin(ans)</tt>."
msgstr ""

#: features.html
msgid "Also, for some functions you may skip the parentheses if you pass simple number or variable, <tt>sin 0.1</tt> is as valid as <tt>sin(0.1)</tt>."
msgstr ""

#: features.html
msgid "Speaking about parentheses, closing them can be left to SpeedCrunch, e.g. <tt>cos(pi/4</tt> is automatically corrected to <tt>cos(pi/4)</tt>."
